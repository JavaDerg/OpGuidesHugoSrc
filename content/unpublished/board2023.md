Last year, 2023, I started the year with a lot of goals. Some of them I accomplished, others not so much. One, from the start, was to motivate my creative mind a bit more. To that end, I made a board with some of my favorite ideas and creative guidance I could. A mix of motivation, advice, ideas, and inspiration. This is that board, with some modifications, digitized. 

While the contents of this board come from a variety of sources, the biggest two influences were the [Catastrotivity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Tx6U5OhMDg) series on YouTube and [Wonderbook: The Illustrated Guide to Creating Imaginative Fiction](https://www.amazon.com/Wonderbook-Illustrated-Creating-Imaginative-Fiction/dp/1419704427/). The first of which I thought had such a good opening message that I want to open with the hook of it ripped off (with some modification).

Great art comes from vulnerability & truth

Action or <span style="color:red;">RE</span>Action?

Upclose, Afar, or Aftermath?

Change PERspective - New character view? New Information?

<h2 style="font-family: 'Julius Sans One';margin:-.2em;color:#88FFFF">You don't have to write the beginning first</h2>

Breath the flowers and dirt of where your tombstone will lie,

before that, give them reasons to cry.



Don't stop until the result matches your vision and your own work becomes your greatest inspiration.



Don't be [r/menwritingwomen](r/menwritingwomen)

Smell, Sight, Taste, Propeocetion, Time, Heart rate

Memory & Experiance of the event varies from person to person.



Consider **WHY** you want to make, not WHAT you want to make

The second hardest thing is getting started.</br> The hardest is not giving up

</div>

Don't explain what characters should see as normal: Getting eaten by a space squid to teleport, snail phones.



Look where railroads used to be.



[picture of skyscrapers looking at pyramids]



Hear the call, create the response.



Study anatomy to draw monsters [Waiting on MAW pic]

Study fear to write hope

Study love ‚ù§Ô∏è to write tragedy üñ§



Everbody love's a trickster character.



Transformation?

Discovery?

Exploration?

Event?

Stories require conflict. False hope. Set backs. Consequences. Secrets. Lies. Cultural Differences. TENSION. Battles. Rage. Something to fight for. Rash decisions

Conflict is competing interests.

And so in our pain we sang for the the deaf, to the children we'd never have

FUCK TRADITION



It's only good if you keep going. Add every detail. Make it obnoxious. Make it loud.

[QUEEN] OH OH OH OH OH OH OH



Animalistic. Heat. Hunger. Hurt.

[Bleeding Tree] Think about the trees, and how they bleed



And you dare ask me who I am?

I am no [Engineer/Poet] but [An Engineer / A poet]



Do not dismiss objects:

* Longboard
* Jacket w/ Pins
* Eragon's Sword
* Dean's Impalla

Who made it? Where? Why? Who wants it? Can it be replaced?



Stories don't need to tell people how to feel.



A mother fuck and her fucklings

# Warm Ups

Name all the uses for a ___

mutate an an animal?

 * What is it's life cycle?







World Building

Transparent: climate, trade routes, 

For history, stick to only talking about events that affect the present

The initial conflict should open up to bigger one, the inital one only being a small piece.



Trade and relation charts - What does each give/get/suffer from another (if anything at all)

Explore Google Maps



non human senses, extended range?

Transportation & Communication



The Hero's Journey: Separate, Initiate, Return

Silence can be more powerful than abundance, and even add more to it.

INTERRUPTION

Puzzle, Myster, Rouglite, Action, Adventure, Rhythm, Platformer, Simulation, Sandbox, Racing ... or a combonation?

CHARACTER DESIGN IS HARD.



[Dere? Deredere, Tsundere? Yandere? Dandere?...](https://www.cbr.com/anime-types-of-dere/)



Talented, but do they want to do it? What is their relationship to society?



Not all things are best done on a computer. Text editing, ^ Revision, for example.



Ideas are in everything. Biology. Religion, Rock n Roll, Ganderning, Sailing, Fursuiting, 



Chart out characters and their relationships

What about absent / dead / missing people?

What relationships are 1-sidded?



Make people believe you PERSONALLY have lived through what you're writing.



Keep asking questions, Keep adding details.



Lie witness to the uncountable fucks that I may never give.
