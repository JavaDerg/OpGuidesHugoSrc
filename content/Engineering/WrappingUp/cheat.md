> For Matplotlib, I do recommend looking at the available [Matplotlib colormaps](https://matplotlib.org/stable/tutorials/colors/colormaps.html) and [color map normalization](https://matplotlib.org/stable/tutorials/colors/colormapnorms.html#sphx-glr-tutorials-colors-colormapnorms-py) as the colors used to view your data can make a huge difference in how readable it is

#### Machine Learning

> Obviously Tensorflow, PyTorch, Keras, etc. exist. This list is for the stuff you don't already know about
>
> That said, it's worth noting that `tensorflow-rocm` exists, which *might* work for you if you have an AMD graphics card and don't want to shell out for a different GPU just for CUDA support.
